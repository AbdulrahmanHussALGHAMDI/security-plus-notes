# 🔐 1.2 – The CIA Triad

📚 Based on Professor Messer – The CIA Triad (5:17)

## 🎯 Overview

The **CIA Triad** (or AIC Triad) is the foundational model of cybersecurity.  
It defines **three core principles** that guide security policies, controls, and system designs:

- **C**onfidentiality
- **I**ntegrity
- **A**vailability

---

## 🔒 Confidentiality

Keep sensitive data **private** and only visible to **authorized users**.

### Techniques:
- **Encryption** – Converts readable data into unreadable ciphertext
- **Access Controls** – Limits who can read/write resources
- **Two-Factor Authentication** – Adds a verification layer to access

> 🧠 Goal: Prevent unauthorized disclosure of information

---

## 🧬 Integrity

Ensure data is **accurate**, **unchanged**, and **trustworthy**.

### Techniques:
- **Hashing** – Maps data to a fixed value for tamper detection
- **Digital Signatures** – Proves the data hasn't been altered
- **Certificates** – Help verify identity of senders
- **Non-repudiation** – Sender cannot deny they sent the message

> 🧠 Goal: Detect or prevent unauthorized data modification

---

## 📶 Availability

Keep systems and data **accessible** when needed.

### Techniques:
- **Redundancy** – Backups, replication, multiple servers
- **Fault Tolerance** – Keeps system running despite failures
- **Patching** – Keeps systems stable and secure

> 🧠 Goal: Ensure uptime and reliability for users
