## 🎯 What Is Gap Analysis?

A **gap analysis** helps organizations understand the **difference between their current security posture and their desired state**.

> 🧠 It’s about asking: “Where are we now? Where do we want to be? And how do we get there?”

The result is a structured plan to close the "gap" between the two.

---

## 📊 What Does It Involve?

Gap analysis is **not a quick checklist** — it typically requires:

- Deep technical research
- Extensive data collection and documentation
- Participation from many departments
- Weeks or even months of effort

---

## 🧭 Choosing a Framework or Baseline

Organizations must define what “success” looks like. This can be based on:

### 🔹 Internal Goals
- Custom policies or standards tailored to business needs

### 🔹 Formal External Standards
Examples include:

| Standard | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2** | Guidelines for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems |
| **ISO/IEC 27001** | Framework for establishing and maintaining an Information Security Management System (ISMS) |

## 👥 Evaluate People and Processes

Gap analysis doesn’t just focus on tools — it also assesses people and procedures:

### 🧑‍💼 People
- Formal qualifications and certifications
- Level of training and up-to-date knowledge
- Familiarity with internal policies

### ⚙️ Processes
- How IT systems are currently being used
- Existing security protocols and practices
- Any inefficiencies or misalignments

---

## 🔍 Compare and Contrast

Once the baseline and current state are known:

- Compare the **desired state** against the **actual environment**
- Identify:
  - 🟥 Weaknesses
  - ✅ Effective controls already in place
- Break down the analysis into smaller **security categories** (e.g., network security, access control, physical security)

---

## 📑 Analysis and Report

The outcome is a **formal gap analysis report**:

### 🔍 It should include:
- ✅ A detailed summary of the current security posture
- 🎯 Clearly defined target objectives or baselines
- 🛠️ A proposed action plan (with steps, cost, timeline, and change control)

> 💡 The goal is to **bridge the gap** efficiently and strategically.
