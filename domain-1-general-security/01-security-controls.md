## üéØ Overview

Security controls are safeguards designed to **prevent**, **detect**, **respond to**, or **recover from** cybersecurity threats.  
They apply to various **assets** ‚Äî including data, systems, and physical property ‚Äî and are organized by **categories** and **control types**.

> üí° The goal of controls: **Reduce risk**, **minimize damage**, and **maintain continuity**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Managing Controls in Practice

- Security controls are **not always exclusive** ‚Äî a single control can belong to **multiple types**.
- Organizations may:
